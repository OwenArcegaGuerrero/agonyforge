# This is the highest version of RabbitMQ that is supported by AWS's "Amazon MQ"

# in AWS, so I'm trying to keep things like this as close as possible to what you'd

# If you'd rather use ActiveMQ here's a sample configuration for it.
# This is the highest version supported by AWS's "Amazon MQ" version of ActiveMQ as
# of writing this.
#
# I stopped using it and switched to RabbitMQ because this version is getting pretty
# old. Apache released an update to ActiveMQ called Artemis and Spring Boot's starter
# library for activemq stopped getting updated in favor of their artemis one. Since I
# can't use newer versions on AWS and I can't use the old Spring Boot library in the
# latest Spring Boot, it made sense to swap over to RabbitMQ which seems to be getting
# more current support over there.
