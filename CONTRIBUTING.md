## How to contribute to Agony Forge

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/scionaltera/agonyforge/issues).

* If it's a security vulnerability or exploit that could be problematic if it were made public, you can submit a [security advisory](https://github.com/scionaltera/agonyforge/security/advisories) privately instead of a public issue.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/scionaltera/agonyforge/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* [Fork the Agony Forge project](https://github.com/scionaltera/agonyforge/fork) and write your patch on a branch in your fork.

* [Open a new GitHub pull request](https://github.com/scionaltera/agonyforge/pulls) with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, usability, testability, or documentation of Agony Forge will generally not be accepted, but please feel welcome to point these types of issues out so they can be fixed.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/scionaltera/agonyforge/issues/new) describing the feature or change you wish to make. Collect feedback from the developers and community. Nobody wants to spend the time writing a bunch of new code only to find out that it can't be accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Agony Forge in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/scionaltera/agonyforge/discussions).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Agony Forge documentation?**

* If you'd like to [contribute to the Wiki](https://github.com/scionaltera/agonyforge/wiki) but don't have access, feel free to [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/scionaltera/agonyforge/issues/new) with the change you'd like to see. If it is accepted, someone with access will apply the change for you.

Agony Forge is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in!

Thanks!
